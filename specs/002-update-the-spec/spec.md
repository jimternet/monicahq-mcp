# Feature Specification: Dual Deployment Mode Support for MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `002-update-the-spec`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "update the spec to include that I want to be able for the user to runa as java MCP server or a Docker one"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � User wants flexibility to run MCP server in different deployment modes
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: system administrators, developers, end users
   � Actions: deploy, configure, run MCP server
   � Data: deployment configurations, environment settings
   � Constraints: must maintain same functionality across modes
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � No major ambiguities - deployment flexibility is clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flows for both deployment modes
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each deployment mode must provide identical functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Deployment configurations and runtime environments
7. Run Review Checklist
   � No implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need: flexible deployment options
- L Avoid HOW to implement (specific containerization or JVM details)
- =e Written for system administrators and deployment teams

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
System administrators and developers need flexible deployment options for the MonicaHQ MCP server to accommodate different infrastructure environments, security requirements, and operational preferences. Users should be able to choose between running the server as a standalone Java application or as a containerized Docker service, with both modes providing identical functionality and user experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to deploy on a traditional server environment, **When** they choose Java deployment mode, **Then** they can run the MCP server directly with Java runtime and access all MonicaHQ operations
2. **Given** a user prefers containerized deployments, **When** they choose Docker deployment mode, **Then** they can run the MCP server in a container and access identical MonicaHQ operations
3. **Given** a user switches from Java to Docker deployment, **When** they configure the same environment variables, **Then** the server behavior and available operations remain identical
4. **Given** a Claude Desktop user connects to either deployment mode, **When** they request available tools, **Then** they see the same 50 categorized operations regardless of deployment method
5. **Given** either deployment mode is running, **When** users perform CRM operations, **Then** response times and functionality are equivalent across both modes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Java runtime is unavailable but Docker is requested? System should provide clear error messages about missing dependencies
- How does system handle environment variable configuration differences? Both modes should accept identical configuration parameters
- What occurs during resource constraints? Both deployment modes should handle memory and CPU limitations gracefully
- How are updates managed across deployment modes? Users should be able to update either deployment type independently
- What happens with network connectivity issues? Both modes should provide identical error handling and retry behavior

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide two distinct deployment modes: Java application and Docker container
- **FR-002**: Both deployment modes MUST offer identical MonicaHQ MCP server functionality
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to configure both modes using the same environment variables and parameters
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear documentation for deploying and running each mode
- **FR-005**: Both deployment modes MUST support the same authentication mechanisms for MonicaHQ integration
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to switch between deployment modes without losing configuration or functionality
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide identical performance characteristics across both deployment modes
- **FR-008**: Both modes MUST support the same logging and monitoring capabilities
- **FR-009**: System MUST offer equivalent error handling and recovery mechanisms in both deployment modes
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to integrate either deployment mode with Claude Desktop using identical configuration
- **FR-011**: Both deployment modes MUST support the same network connectivity and firewall configurations
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide validation tools to verify deployment mode functionality
- **FR-013**: Users MUST be able to scale and manage both deployment modes according to their infrastructure needs
- **FR-014**: Both modes MUST maintain the same security posture and compliance capabilities
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide troubleshooting guidance specific to each deployment mode

### Key Entities
- **Java Deployment Configuration**: Runtime settings, classpath, JVM parameters, and environment variables for standalone execution
- **Docker Deployment Configuration**: Container image settings, volume mounts, network configurations, and environment variables for containerized execution
- **Environment Variables**: Shared configuration parameters that work identically across both deployment modes (API URLs, tokens, logging levels)
- **Deployment Validation**: Health checks and verification procedures to ensure both modes are functioning correctly
