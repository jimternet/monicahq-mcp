# Feature Specification: API Gap Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-specification`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create a specification that takes the output of @docs/monica-api-diff-analysis.md and translate that into a spec that addresses the gaps - specifically ### L **ENTITIES ON WEBSITE NOT IMPLEMENTED*"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identified: Request to address unimplemented Monica API entities
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: API consumers, developers using Monica integration
   � Actions: Implement missing entities and operations
   � Data: Users entity, Compliance entity, related operations
   � Constraints: API returns 404 for Users, no clear endpoints for Compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we attempt Users entity despite 404 response?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What compliance operations are actually needed?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Define implementation of missing entities
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement addresses specific gap from diff analysis
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Users, Compliance, related missing operations
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Users API returns 404 - may be admin-only"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Monica API consumer, I need complete access to all documented Monica entities so that I can fully integrate with Monica CRM without encountering gaps in functionality, especially for user management and compliance features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Monica documents Users entity, **When** accessing user operations, **Then** basic user profile information is retrievable
2. **Given** Monica mentions Compliance features, **When** requesting compliance data, **Then** relevant compliance information is accessible
3. **Given** missing Contact operations identified, **When** searching contacts, **Then** query-based search returns filtered results
4. **Given** contact has career information, **When** updating work details, **Then** career data is properly stored
5. **Given** contact has history, **When** requesting audit logs, **Then** chronological activity log is returned
6. **Given** tag exists, **When** listing contacts by tag, **Then** all tagged contacts are returned

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Users API requires admin privileges?
- How does system handle Compliance endpoints that don't exist?
- What response for audit logs on new contacts with no history?
- How to handle tag-based queries with non-existent tags?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Missing Entity: Users
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide access to user profile information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: scope of user data needed]
- **FR-002**: System MUST handle Users API 404 responses gracefully with clear error messages
- **FR-003**: System MUST differentiate between permission-denied and not-implemented for Users entity

#### Missing Entity: Compliance  
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide compliance data access if endpoints are available
- **FR-005**: System MUST document which compliance features are actually accessible
- **FR-006**: System MUST clearly indicate compliance limitations to users

#### Missing Contact Operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement contact search with query parameter (`GET /contacts?query=`)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support updating contact career information (`PUT /contacts/:id/work`)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide contact audit log access (`GET /contacts/:id/logs`)
- **FR-010**: System MUST list contacts filtered by tag (`GET /tags/{:id}/contacts`)

#### Error Handling
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide meaningful error messages for unavailable entities
- **FR-012**: System MUST distinguish between not-implemented and permission errors
- **FR-013**: System MUST document known limitations in user-facing documentation

### Key Entities
- **Users**: Monica user accounts with profile information, permissions, and settings
- **Compliance**: Data retention, privacy, and regulatory compliance information
- **Contact Search Results**: Filtered list of contacts based on query parameters
- **Contact Career**: Work-related information including job title, company, and career history
- **Contact Audit Log**: Chronological record of all changes and interactions with a contact
- **Tagged Contact List**: Contacts associated with specific tags for organization

## Notes
Based on the monica-api-diff-analysis.md, this specification addresses:
1. **Two missing entities**: Users (returns 404) and Compliance (no clear endpoints)
2. **Four missing Contact operations**: search, career update, audit logs, tag filtering

Key considerations:
- Users API may be admin-only or not implemented in current Monica version
- Compliance features are mentioned but lack concrete endpoint documentation
- The four missing Contact operations have clear endpoints and should be implementable
