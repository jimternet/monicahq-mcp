# Feature Specification: Fix Claude Desktop MCP Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-fix-claude-desktop`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Fix Claude Desktop MCP integration - resolve tool not found errors and validate all 122 operations"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Fixing MCP integration issues with Claude Desktop
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: Claude Desktop (actor), MCP tools (data), tool discovery (action), validation (constraint)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Performance targets for tool execution marked
   ’ Error recovery strategies marked
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary scenario: User invokes MCP tools through Claude Desktop
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ MCP Tools, Tool Parameters, Validation Results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Some clarifications needed on performance and monitoring
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Claude Desktop user, I want to reliably invoke all 122 MonicaHQ operations through the MCP protocol, so that I can manage my CRM data directly from my AI assistant without encountering "tool not found" errors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Claude Desktop is configured with the MonicaHQ MCP server, **When** a user requests to create an activity with valid parameters, **Then** the activity should be successfully created in MonicaHQ and confirmation returned
2. **Given** the MCP server is running, **When** Claude Desktop requests the tools list, **Then** all 122 operations should be discoverable and properly formatted
3. **Given** a user provides incorrect parameters for a tool, **When** the tool is invoked, **Then** a clear error message explaining the parameter requirements should be returned
4. **Given** the MCP server encounters a MonicaHQ API error, **When** a tool is invoked, **Then** the error should be gracefully handled and reported to the user

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Claude Desktop sends malformed JSON-RPC requests?
- How does system handle when MonicaHQ API is unavailable?
- What occurs when tool parameters have format mismatches (e.g., arrays vs objects)?
- How are concurrent tool invocations handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST correctly expose all 122 MCP operations to Claude Desktop via the tools/list endpoint
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate tool parameters according to their defined schemas before execution
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle both array and object formats for multi-value parameters (e.g., attendees field)
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide detailed error messages when tool invocation fails, including parameter requirements
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all Claude Desktop interactions for debugging purposes without contaminating STDIO output
- **FR-006**: System MUST support end-to-end testing of the STDIO protocol communication
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a verification mechanism to confirm Claude Desktop integration is working
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing test suites while fixing parameter mismatches
- **FR-009**: System MUST complete tool execution within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable response time not specified - 5 seconds, 30 seconds?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum concurrent tool invocations not specified - 10, 100, unlimited?]
- **FR-011**: Administrator MUST be able to monitor tool usage and failures via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: monitoring approach not specified - logs, metrics, dashboard?]

### Key Entities
- **MCP Tool**: Represents a single operation (one of 122), including its name, description, parameter schema, and execution handler
- **Tool Parameter**: Defines expected input format, validation rules, and whether parameter is required or optional
- **Tool Invocation**: Records a single tool call including request parameters, execution result, timing, and any errors
- **Validation Result**: Contains validation status, error messages, and parameter-specific feedback for failed validations

---

## Execution Status
*Updated by main() during processing*

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified
- [ ] Review checklist passed (3 clarifications needed)

---

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Claude Desktop must be installed and configured
- MonicaHQ instance must be accessible with valid API credentials
- MCP protocol version compatibility between server and Claude Desktop

### Assumptions
- Users have basic familiarity with Claude Desktop
- MonicaHQ API remains stable during implementation
- All 122 operations are still required (no deprecations)

---

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- 100% of 122 operations discoverable by Claude Desktop
- Zero "tool not found" errors for properly formatted requests
- All parameter validation errors include actionable feedback

### Secondary Metrics
- Tool invocation success rate > 95% (excluding user errors)
- Average tool response time meets performance requirements
- Debug logs sufficient to diagnose any integration issues
