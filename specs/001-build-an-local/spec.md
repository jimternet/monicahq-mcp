# Feature Specification: MonicaHQ MCP Server Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-local`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build an local mcp server that can interact with and operate on a specified monicahq instance"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extracted: MCP server, MonicaHQ integration, local deployment
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: System administrators, API clients
   ’ Actions: CRUD operations on CRM entities
   ’ Data: Contacts, activities, calls, notes, tasks, etc.
   ’ Constraints: Local server, MonicaHQ compatibility
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Authentication method for MonicaHQ API
   ’ Server configuration requirements
   ’ Error handling strategies
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Defined primary user story for CRM operations
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ 52 operations across 12 entity types
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ 12 CRM entity types with relationships
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Multiple clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator or automation developer, I need to programmatically interact with my MonicaHQ CRM instance to manage contacts, activities, and related data through a standardized interface that allows me to automate CRM operations and integrate with other systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a configured MCP server with MonicaHQ credentials, **When** a client requests to create a new contact, **Then** the contact is successfully created in MonicaHQ and the server returns the new contact details
2. **Given** an existing contact in MonicaHQ, **When** a client requests to add a note to that contact, **Then** the note is attached to the contact and visible in the MonicaHQ interface
3. **Given** multiple contacts with various tags, **When** a client queries contacts by specific tag, **Then** only contacts with that tag are returned
4. **Given** a scheduled reminder in the system, **When** a client requests to update the reminder date, **Then** the reminder is rescheduled in MonicaHQ
5. **Given** an ongoing conversation thread, **When** a client adds a new message, **Then** the message appears in the conversation history with correct timestamp

### Edge Cases
- What happens when MonicaHQ instance is unreachable?
- How does system handle invalid contact IDs or references?
- What occurs when attempting to delete entities with dependencies?
- How are rate limits from MonicaHQ API handled?
- What happens with concurrent modifications to the same entity?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide create, read, update, and delete operations for contacts
- **FR-002**: System MUST support management of activities linked to contacts (5 operations)
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable call logging with full CRUD capabilities (5 operations)
- **FR-004**: System MUST manage contact fields including custom field definitions (4 operations)
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle contact tagging operations (add/remove tags)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support conversation management including message threading (6 operations)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide journal entry operations for contact history (5 operations)
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable note management attached to contacts (5 operations)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle reminder scheduling and management (5 operations)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support tag creation and management independent of contacts (5 operations)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide task management capabilities (5 operations)
- **FR-012**: System MUST authenticate with MonicaHQ instance using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method - API key, OAuth, username/password?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST connect to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single instance or multiple MonicaHQ instances?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle errors from MonicaHQ API and provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error reporting mechanism - logs, callbacks, status codes?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST operate as a local server on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific port range or configuration?]
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: connection persistence - keep-alive, reconnect on failure?]
- **FR-017**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: concurrent client connections - single or multiple?]

### Key Entities

- **ContactField**: Custom field definitions for extending contact information
- **ContactTag**: Relationship between contacts and tags for categorization
- **Conversation**: Thread of messages between users and contacts
- **ConversationMessage**: Individual messages within a conversation thread
- **JournalEntry**: Diary-style entries documenting interactions or observations about contacts
- **Note**: Free-form text annotations attached to contacts
- **Reminder**: Scheduled notifications for future actions related to contacts
