# Feature Specification: Constitutional Governance Framework and Validation Suite

**Feature Branch**: `003-constitutional-governance-framework`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Input**: User description: "Constitutional governance framework and comprehensive validation suite for MCP server quality assurance"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Development teams need a constitutional governance framework with comprehensive validation tools to ensure the MonicaHQ MCP server maintains high quality, protocol compliance, and architectural consistency. The system must enforce core principles through automated validation while providing developers with testing tools to verify compliance before deployment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer makes changes to the MCP server, **When** they run constitutional validation, **Then** the system verifies compliance with all 5 core principles and reports violations
2. **Given** the MCP server runs in STDIO mode, **When** validation tests execute, **Then** STDOUT contains only clean JSON-RPC responses without contamination
3. **Given** a team wants to validate production readiness, **When** they run comprehensive testing, **Then** all 7 validation phases pass including protocol, architecture, and security checks
4. **Given** developers need to test Claude Desktop integration, **When** they run integration validation, **Then** the system verifies configuration, connectivity, and protocol compatibility
5. **Given** new team members join the project, **When** they access governance documentation, **Then** they understand constitutional principles and have access to validation tools

### Edge Cases
- What happens when constitutional violations are detected? System must provide specific remediation guidance
- How does validation handle missing environment variables? Tests should skip safely or use appropriate fallbacks
- What occurs when MCP protocol changes? Constitutional principles should guide adaptation strategies
- How are test failures communicated? Clear reporting with actionable next steps required
- What happens during CI/CD pipeline failures? Constitutional compliance must be enforced as quality gate
