# Feature Specification: Refined Dual-Mode Architecture with Appropriate Reactive Patterns

**Feature Branch**: `004-refined-dual-mode`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Input**: User description: "Refined dual-mode architecture with appropriate reactive patterns for STDIO and Web Server modes"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Development teams need an intelligently designed dual-mode MCP server architecture that uses reactive patterns appropriately based on operational context. The system should use WebFlux for I/O-bound operations (external API calls, Web Server mode) while allowing traditional Spring Boot for inherently sequential operations (STDIO MCP protocol processing), optimizing both performance and architectural simplicity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the server handles external MonicaHQ API calls, **When** making HTTP requests, **Then** the system uses WebFlux reactive patterns for optimal I/O performance
2. **Given** the server operates in Web Server mode, **When** handling WebSocket connections and HTTP endpoints, **Then** the system uses WebFlux for concurrent request handling
3. **Given** the server runs in STDIO mode, **When** processing MCP JSON-RPC messages, **Then** the system may use traditional Spring Boot since protocol is inherently sequential
4. **Given** developers review the architecture, **When** they examine I/O patterns, **Then** reactive usage aligns with actual concurrency needs rather than blanket application
5. **Given** the system needs circuit breaker protection, **When** external calls fail, **Then** Resilience4j patterns work effectively with both reactive and traditional code paths

### Edge Cases
- What happens when STDIO and Web Server modes run simultaneously? Architecture should cleanly separate concerns without conflicts
- How does dependency injection work across reactive and traditional components? Spring Boot should handle both patterns seamlessly  
- What occurs during high load scenarios? Each mode should scale appropriately for its operational characteristics
- How are errors handled across different reactive patterns? Consistent error handling regardless of underlying implementation
- What happens during configuration changes? Both modes should adapt configuration without architectural conflicts

## Requirements
