# Feature Specification: Critical Monica API Gaps Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `005-use-the-findings`  
**Created**: September 21, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "use the findings you just descibred to address teh critical gaps"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature targets critical API gaps identified in comprehensive analysis
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: CRM users managing business relationships
   ’ Actions: Create, manage, and track relationships and companies
   ’ Data: Relationship mappings, company information, contact associations
   ’ Constraints: Must integrate with existing Monica API structure
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [RESOLVED] All critical gaps clearly identified from previous analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Core relationship management and company tracking workflows
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Phase 1 implementation covering highest impact missing functionality
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Relationships, Companies, Relationship Types, Relationship Type Groups
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec focuses on business value without implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a CRM user managing personal and professional relationships through Monica, I need to map relationships between contacts and track company affiliations so that I can understand the network of connections in my personal and professional life, enabling better relationship management and business networking.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have multiple contacts in my Monica account, **When** I want to establish that Contact A is the spouse of Contact B, **Then** I can create a relationship between them with the appropriate relationship type
2. **Given** I have contacts who work for various companies, **When** I want to track their professional affiliations, **Then** I can create company records and associate contacts with their employers
3. **Given** I want to understand my network connections, **When** I view a contact's profile, **Then** I can see all their relationships to other contacts and their company affiliations
4. **Given** I need to organize relationship types, **When** I set up my relationship management, **Then** I can create custom relationship types grouped into logical categories (family, professional, friendship, etc.)
5. **Given** I have established relationships and company connections, **When** I need to update or remove them, **Then** I can modify or delete these associations while maintaining data integrity

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to create a duplicate relationship between the same two contacts?
- How does the system handle circular relationship dependencies?
- What occurs when I delete a contact that has multiple relationships?
- How are company associations managed when a contact changes employers?
- What validation prevents invalid relationship type assignments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
