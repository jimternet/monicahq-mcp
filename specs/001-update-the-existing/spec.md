**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Complete - Production Ready  
**Input**: User description: "update the existing specification to reflect what is currently built"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ User wants documentation of existing built system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Claude Desktop users, MonicaHQ CRM users
   ’ Actions: CRM operations, contact management, activity tracking
   ’ Data: Contacts, activities, tasks, notes, reminders, tags, conversations
   ’ Constraints: OAuth2 authentication, MCP protocol compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ No unclear aspects - system is fully implemented and tested
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flows for CRM operations via Claude Desktop
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ All requirements are implemented and testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ 12 MonicaHQ entities with full CRUD operations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No clarifications needed - production-ready system
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec reflects completed implementation)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users can accomplish with MonicaHQ through Claude Desktop
- L Technical implementation details are in documentation, not this spec
- =e Written for business stakeholders and Claude Desktop users

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Claude Desktop users can seamlessly manage their MonicaHQ CRM data through natural language interactions. Users can create, read, update, and delete contacts, activities, tasks, reminders, notes, tags, calls, and conversations without leaving their Claude Desktop interface. The system provides organized, categorized tools that make CRM operations intuitive and efficient.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Claude Desktop user with MonicaHQ access, **When** they ask "Create a new contact named John Smith with email john@example.com", **Then** the system creates the contact and returns confirmation with the contact ID
2. **Given** an existing contact in MonicaHQ, **When** the user asks "Add a note to John Smith about our meeting today", **Then** the system creates and associates the note with the contact
3. **Given** multiple contacts exist, **When** the user requests "List all contacts with 'Smith' in the name", **Then** the system returns a filtered list of matching contacts
4. **Given** a task exists, **When** the user asks "Mark task ID 123 as completed", **Then** the system updates the task status and confirms the change
5. **Given** the user wants to track interactions, **When** they say "Log a call with Sarah Johnson about project discussion", **Then** the system creates a call record and links it to the contact

### Edge Cases
- What happens when API authentication fails? System returns clear error message and suggests token refresh
- How does system handle invalid contact IDs? Returns "Contact not found" with suggestion to list contacts first
- What occurs with malformed data? System validates input and provides specific error messages
- How are pagination limits handled? System automatically manages large result sets with configurable page sizes
- What happens during MonicaHQ API outages? Circuit breaker activates with graceful degradation and retry logic

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide 50 categorized operations across 12 MonicaHQ entity types
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize tools into 3 logical categories: Contact Management, Productivity & Organization, and Activity & Communication
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to perform complete CRUD operations on contacts, activities, tasks, notes, reminders, tags, calls, and conversations
- **FR-004**: System MUST authenticate with MonicaHQ using OAuth2 Bearer tokens
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time access to MonicaHQ data through MCP protocol over STDIO
- **FR-006**: System MUST support both individual entity operations and relationship management (e.g., adding tags to contacts)
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle pagination for large datasets with configurable limits
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear, categorized tool descriptions with [Category] prefixes for easy identification
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate all input data and provide meaningful error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST support filtering and searching across all entity types
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain data consistency with MonicaHQ instance in real-time
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide robust error handling with circuit breaker protection
- **FR-013**: System MUST support multiple deployment modes (Spring Boot JAR, Docker, Claude Desktop)
- **FR-014**: System MUST log all operations while maintaining clean STDIO for MCP protocol
- **FR-015**: System MUST pass comprehensive test suite covering all 50 operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Contact**: Core entity representing people in CRM with name, email, phone, address, and custom fields
- **ContactField**: Custom fields attached to contacts for additional metadata
- **ContactTag**: Many-to-many relationship linking contacts with tags for categorization
- **Activity**: Interactions and events associated with contacts (meetings, calls, emails)
- **Call**: Phone call records with duration, outcome, and notes
- **Note**: Text-based annotations linked to contacts or activities
- **Task**: Action items with due dates, priorities, and completion status
- **Reminder**: Time-based alerts for important dates or follow-ups
- **Tag**: Labels for categorizing and organizing contacts and activities
- **Conversation**: Message threads between users and contacts
- **ConversationMessage**: Individual messages within conversation threads
- **JournalEntry**: Personal notes and reflections (disabled - not supported by MonicaHQ)
